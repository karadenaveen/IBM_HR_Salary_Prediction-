💼 IBM HR Salary Prediction
A Machine Learning project to predict employee salaries using IBM HR Analytics data. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling to estimate salaries based on various employee attributes.

📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the salary of employees using various features from IBM HR Analytics dataset. This can help organizations estimate fair salaries, detect disparities, and make informed HR decisions.

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. 🔍 Data Exploration
Load the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset

Understand feature types (categorical, numerical)

Identify missing values, data types, distributions

2. 🧼 Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values 

Encode categorical variables 

Normalize or scale numerical variables

Feature selection and transformation

3. 📈 Model Training
Split the data into training and testing sets

Trained various regression models:

Logistic Regression Regression

Random Forest Regressor
